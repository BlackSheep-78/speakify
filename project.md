1. Introduction
    - Purpose: Briefly explain the purpose of your project. For example:
        - Why are you building a translation database?
        - Who are the users (translators, organizations, AI systems, etc.)?
        - What problem does it solve?
    - Scope: Define the scope of the project, outlining what the system will (and will not) cover.

2. System Overview
    - Objective: Summarize the goals of the system, such as:
        - Efficiently storing translations.
        - Supporting multiple languages and sources.
        - Querying translations both ways (Original → Translation and Translation → Original).
    - Key Features:** Highlight major features, such as:
        - Language and source management.
        - Tracking translation versions.
        - Handling missing translations.
        - Scalability for adding new languages and sentences.

3. Database Design
    - ER Diagram (Entity-Relationship Diagram): Visual representation of the database schema, showing tables, relationships, and foreign keys.
    - Table Descriptions: Provide a detailed explanation of each table and its purpose, such as:
        - languages: Stores supported languages.
        - sentences: Stores the text of sentences and their associated languages.
        - translation_pairs: Links two sentences as translations of each other.
        - sources: Tracks the sources of translations.
        - translation_pair_sources: Links translation pairs to sources.

4. SQL Schema
    - Include the full SQL schema for creating the database tables.
    - Highlight:
        - Primary and foreign keys.
        - Indexes for performance optimization.
        - Default values and constraints.

5. Functional Requirements
    - CRUD Operations:
        - Create, Read, Update, Delete for each table.
    - Sample Queries:
        - Provide examples of important queries, such as:
            - Find a translation for a sentence.
            - List all sentences without translations.
            - Retrieve all translations linked to a specific source.
    - User Interactions: Explain how users will interact with the system (e.g., through an interface or API).

6. Query Examples
    - Basic Queries: Examples for retrieving data, such as:
        - Get all active languages.
        - Find all sentences in a specific language.
    - Complex Queries:
        - Find sentences missing translations.
        - Track translations by source.
        - Retrieve the latest translation version for a pair.

7. System Features and Enhancements
    - Planned Features:
        - Support for additional metadata (e.g., tone or formality of translations).
        - Integration with external tools (e.g., APIs for machine translation).
        - Adding a review or approval process for translations.
    - Future Scalability:
        - Support for larger datasets (e.g., millions of translations).
        - Handling polyglot translations (one sentence translated into multiple languages).

8. Challenges and Considerations
    - Data Integrity:
        - How to ensure translations are accurate and consistent.
    - Performance:
        - Optimizing for fast queries on large datasets.
    - Version Control:
        - Managing multiple versions of the same translation.
    - Redundancy:
        - Avoiding duplicate sentences or translation pairs.

9. Testing
    - Unit Tests: Describe how individual components are tested (e.g., validating database operations).
    - Integration Tests: Test the entire system to ensure different parts (e.g., tables and queries) work together.
    - Sample Data: Provide test data to demonstrate how the system works.

10. Conclusion
    - Summarize the project’s achievements and functionality.
    - Mention how it can be expanded or improved.

11. Appendix
    - Glossary: Define terms used in the project (e.g., "translation pair," "source").
    - References: List any resources, tools, or frameworks used.
    - Changelog: Track changes to the project over time.

Here is your **copy-paste friendly** version of the key points in the requested format:

---

- **1. Introduction**:  
    - **Project Name**: Define the official project name.  
    - **Version & Date**: Indicate the document version and the date of creation.  
    - **Purpose**: Clearly state why this project exists.  
    - **Context**: Explain the problem this project is solving.  
    - **Objectives**: Define what the project aims to achieve (e.g., structured translation storage, efficient querying, scalability).  

- **2. Scope of the Project**:  
    - Define what the system will cover (e.g., storing, retrieving, and managing translations).  
    - Define what the system will **NOT** cover (e.g., real-time AI translation, front-end user interface).  
    - Identify target users (e.g., developers, translators, organizations, AI systems).  

- **3. Functional Requirements**:  
    - **Database Structure & Schema**:  
        - Define core entities (**Languages, Sentences, Translation Pairs, Sources**).  
        - Explain how translations are linked and tracked.  
    - **Core Features**:  
        - Translation Storage & Retrieval.  
        - Multi-language Support.  
        - Bidirectional Querying.  
        - Versioning for Translations.  
        - Performance Optimization.  
    - **User Interactions**:  
        - Define how users or applications will interact with the system (API? Direct SQL queries?).  
    - **Security & Permissions**:  
        - Define who can read, write, and update translations.  
        - Explain how data integrity is maintained.  

- **4. Technical Specifications**:  
    - **Technology Stack**:  
        - **Database**: MySQL (or another RDBMS).  
        - **Backend**: (Optional, if an API is provided).  
        - **Infrastructure**: Cloud-based or local hosting.  
        - **Version Control**: Git for schema and query tracking.  
    - **Performance Considerations**:  
        - Implement indexing strategies.  
        - Optimize query execution.  
        - Ensure scalability for large datasets.  

- **5. Constraints & Risks**:  
    - **Technical Constraints**:  
        - Database storage limits.  
        - Query execution time limits.  
    - **Security Risks**:  
        - Prevent unauthorized data access.  
        - Avoid data redundancy.  
    - **Scalability Risks**:  
        - Ensure the system can handle millions of translations.  
        - Future-proofing for new languages.  

- **6. Project Execution Plan**:  
    - **Development Phases**:  
        - Schema Design.  
        - Schema Implementation & CRUD Operations.  
        - Performance Optimization.  
        - Testing & Deployment.  
    - **Estimated Timeline**:  
        - Define each phase with expected completion times.  

- **7. Acceptance Criteria**:  
    - Define when the project is considered ready for use.  
    - Set minimum success requirements.  

- **8. Future Enhancements**:  
    - Integrate with machine translation APIs (Google Translate, DeepL).  
    - Add metadata support (e.g., tone, formality).  
    - Implement a review and approval process.  
    - Expand scalability for millions of translations.  
    - Enable polyglot translation capabilities.  

- **9. Appendix & References**:  
    - Provide a glossary of key terms (e.g., "Translation Pair," "Source").  
    - Include references to external documentation or industry standards.

## 2. Features & Problem Solving  
### **2.1 Application Features**  
- **Multilingual Audio Playlists**: Users can create and customize playlists consisting of Playback Loops with audio files.  
- **Playback Loops (PLs)**: A structured unit that contains a sentence in a source language and its equivalent translations in multiple languages, each with an associated audio file.  
- **Customizable Playback Schema**: Users can define the playback sequence, repetitions, and timing of Playback Loops.  
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Designed to work on mobile phones, desktops, and TVs for a flexible learning experience.  
- **Interactive Learning**: Features like loop mode, adjustable playback speed, and pronunciation practice help reinforce learning.  
- **Intensive Learning Mode**: Allows users to engage in focused and repetitive drills with accelerated playback and adaptive difficulty to enhance retention and fluency.  
- **Offline Support** (Planned): Ability to store translations and audio for offline use.  
- **User Playlists Management**: Create, edit, and organize language learning sessions according to personal learning needs.  
- **Playlists by Difficulty & Context**: Users can categorize playlists based on difficulty levels and specific contexts, such as professional vocabulary for various industries.  
- **Learn on the Go**: Ideal for users who want to learn while walking, running, commuting on the bus or car, or even while working. Designed for people who have limited time to study.  
- **Support for Immigrants**: Provides an accessible way for immigrants to quickly learn and adapt to a new language environment.

| Alert / Error  | Coral Red        | #FF5252   | For deletions, errors, or critical alerts   |

The interface remains predominantly calm and neutral, using vibrant colors only for essential feedback and interactive elements.

---

### 4.2 Typography

Speakify uses clean, modern, and readable fonts optimized for accessibility and multilingual content.

| Use Case      | Font                  | Fallbacks              |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Headings      | Segoe UI Bold          | system-ui, sans-serif  |
| Body Text     | Segoe UI Regular       | Helvetica, Arial       |
| UI Highlights | Antipasto Pro (Light)  | Segoe UI               |

Fonts are chosen for their cross-platform availability and aesthetic harmony. All text is responsive and mobile-optimized.

---

### 4.3 UI Components & Layout

- **Dark Mode**: Planned as an optional setting for comfort during night use.

---

### 4.4 Consistency Across Devices

Speakify is designed as a **responsive progressive web app (PWA)** with consistent behavior and UI structure across:

- 📱 **Mobile phones**: Thumb-friendly controls, bottom navigation
- 💻 **Desktops/Laptops**: Scalable layout with larger reading zones
- 📺 **TVs / Smart Displays**: Large text, high contrast, minimal controls

Grid-based layout, shared styles, and reusable components ensure a unified experience regardless of screen size or input method.

---

## 5. Eco-Responsibility

Speakify is committed to sustainable digital practices. As a modern, web-based language learning platform, it will be designed with eco-responsibility in mind — optimizing for low energy consumption, reduced data transfer, and efficient use of resources across devices.

---

### 5.1 Server Efficiency Considerations
To reduce the platform’s environmental footprint, Speakify will prioritize:

- **Lightweight backend services**: Optimized APIs that serve only essential data.
- **Efficient database queries**: Cached lookups and pagination to reduce server load.
- **Green hosting options**: Preference for providers using renewable energy (e.g., Infomaniak, Scaleway Green).
- **Auto-scaling infrastructure**: Dynamic resource allocation based on demand, avoiding overprovisioning.

---

### 5.2 Low-Bandwidth Optimization
The frontend will be designed to work efficiently even in low-speed or unstable networks, especially for mobile users and global learners.

- **Lazy-loading** of images, audio, and large assets.
- **Adaptive streaming** for audio files (lower bitrate for slow networks).
- **Compressed assets** using WebP, Brotli, and modern web formats.
- **Minimal third-party scripts** to reduce bandwidth waste.

---

### 5.3 Offline Mode Enhancements
Speakify’s offline mode supports both eco-responsibility and accessibility for users with limited or costly data plans.

- **Local storage caching**: Translation blocks and audio files saved locally per playlist.
- **Download-on-demand**: Only resources the user requests will be cached.
- **Preloading control**: Users can choose when and what to make available offline.
- **Battery-aware logic** (Planned): Defers heavy tasks on low battery conditions.

---

### 5.4 Future Improvements
- **Energy-aware dark mode**: Lower screen energy use on OLED devices.
- **Usage-based analytics**: Tracking system load to identify optimization opportunities.
- **Push for lightweight AI**: If AI features are integrated, use serverless or edge-based solutions with minimal energy impact.

> By implementing these strategies, Speakify aims to align high-quality learning experiences with a responsible and sustainable digital footprint.

## 6. SEO & Online Presence

To ensure Speakify reaches a global audience of language learners, educators, and multilingual professionals, a thoughtful SEO strategy will be implemented. The goal is to make the platform highly visible, searchable, and discoverable across multiple languages and regions.

---

### 6.1 SEO Strategy

The SEO approach for Speakify will focus on both **technical SEO** (site structure, performance) and **content SEO** (relevance, clarity).

- **Progressive Web App Optimization**: Ensure that the PWA is crawlable and well-structured, using server-side or dynamic rendering where necessary.
- **Clean URL Structure**: URLs will be semantic and localized (e.g. `/fr/playlists`, `/en/word-of-the-day`).
- **Meta Tags & Open Graph**: Each page will contain meaningful meta titles, descriptions, and social preview metadata.
- **Sitemaps & Robots.txt**: Automatically generated XML sitemaps and properly configured robots.txt files for optimal indexing.
- **Fast Loading Times**: Optimized asset delivery and Core Web Vitals compliance for search engine ranking benefits.

---

### 6.2 Keyword Optimization

Relevant keywords will be researched and integrated into the content, targeting different user intents and learning contexts.

**Primary Keyword Targets:**
- language learning app
- immersive language practice
- translation-based audio learning
- passive language listening
- learn French while commuting
- language playlist builder
- smart vocabulary trainer

**Contextual Keyword Strategies:**
- Long-tail keywords for specific industries (e.g., "learn medical Spanish phrases")
- Location-based or culturally sensitive terms (e.g., "daily English for immigrants in France")
- Voice search optimization (“how do I say hello in Japanese?”)

---

### 6.3 Multilingual Indexing

Since Speakify targets multilingual users worldwide, content must be accessible and indexable in multiple languages.

- **Hreflang Tags**: Used to indicate content language and regional targeting.
- **Language-specific Metadata**: Page titles, descriptions, and slugs will be localized.
- **Localized Content URLs**: `/fr`, `/en`, `/es`, etc. paths for each version of a page.
- **International Keyword Mapping**: Equivalent keywords will be identified across key target languages (EN, FR, ES, DE, etc.).

> All multilingual pages will be SEO-optimized independently to improve visibility in native-language search results.

---

### 6.4 Online Presence & Brand Visibility

Beyond search indexing, Speakify will build awareness through:

- **Social Media Meta Integration** (OG tags, Twitter Cards)
- **Schema.org Markup** for rich search results (e.g., “language course”, “audio lesson”)
- **App Store Optimization** (if PWA is deployed as mobile wrapper)
- **Google Discover Readiness**: Structured articles and featured “Word of the Day” content
- **Future blog or resource center** to generate organic traffic with educational content

> SEO is not just a discovery tool for Speakify — it’s a growth engine aligned with global accessibility and content relevance.

## 2. Scope of Work

### 2.1 Objectives
- Develop an intuitive system for creating and managing **Translation Blocks (TBs)**.
- Enable users to build **custom playlists** for structured language learning.
- Provide seamless **multilingual audio playback** with customizable sequences.
- Ensure compatibility across different devices and screen sizes.

### 2.2 Deliverables
- **Frontend Development:**
  - Web-based UI for playlist and TB management.
  - Interactive player for controlled playback.
  - AJAX-based data handling.
- **Backend Development:**
  - API for retrieving and managing playlists and TBs.
  - Secure and optimized database schema.
  - User authentication and profile management.
- **Documentation:**
  - Setup instructions and API documentation.
  - System architecture and database ER diagram.
  - User guide for playlist and TB management.

### 2.3 Technical Requirements
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap for UI responsiveness)
- **Backend:** PHP, MySQL (REST API for data retrieval)
- **Database:** Tables for `users`, `playlists`, `translation_blocks`, `languages`, and `audio_files`
- **Hosting Environment:** XAMPP for local development
